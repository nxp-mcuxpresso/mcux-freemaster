# What is FreeMASTER?

[FreeMASTER](https://www.nxp.com/freemaster) is a PC-based application developed by NXP for NXP customers. It is a versatile tool usable as a real-time monitor, visualization tool, and a graphical control panel of embedded applications based on the NXP processing units. 

This document describes the embedded-side software driver which implements an interface between the application and the host PC. The interface covers the following communication:
 - **Serial** UART communication either over plain RS232 interface or more typically over a USB-to-Serial either external or built in a debugger probe.
 - **USB** direct connection to target microcontroller
 - **CAN bus**
 - **TCP/IP network** wired or WiFi
 - **Segger J-Link RTT**
 - **JTAG** debug port communication

The driver also supports so-called "packet-driven BDM" interface which enables a protocol-based communication over a debugging port. The BDM stands for Background Debugging Module and its physical implementation is different on each platform. Some platforms leverage a semi-standard JTAG interface, other platforms provide a custom implementation called BDM. Regardless of the name, this debugging interface enables non-intrusive access to the memory space while the target CPU is running. For basic memory read and write operations, there is no communication driver required on the target when communicating with the host PC. Use this driver to get more advanced FreeMASTER protocol features over the BDM interface. The driver must be configured for the packet-driven BDM mode, in which the host PC uses the debugging interface to write serial command frames directly to the target memory buffer. The same method is then used to read response frames from that memory buffer.

Similar to "packet-driven BDM", the FreeMASTER also supports a communication over [J-Link RTT]((https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/about-real-time-transfer/) interface defined by SEGGER Microcontroller GmbH for ARM CortexM-based microcontrollers. This method also uses JTAG physical interface and enables high-speed real time communication to run over the same channel as used for application debugging.

# Driver version 3

This document describes version 3 of the FreeMASTER Communication Driver. This version features the implementation of the new Serial Protocol, which significantly extends the features and security of its predecessor. The new protocol internal number is v4 and its specification is available in the documentation accompanying the driver code.

Driver V3 is deployed to modern 32-bit and 64-bit MCU platforms first, so the portfolio of supported platforms is smaller than for the previous V2 versions. It is recommended to keep using the V2 driver for legacy platforms, such as S08, S12, ColdFire, or Power Architecture. Reach out to [FreeMASTER community](https://community.nxp.com/t5/FreeMASTER/bd-p/freemaster) or to the local NXP representative with requests for more information or to port the V3 driver to legacy MCU devices.

Thanks to a layered approach, the new driver simplifies the porting of the driver to new UART, CAN or networking communication interfaces significantly. Users are encouraged to port the driver to more NXP MCU platforms and contribute the code back to NXP for integration into future releases. Existing code and low-level driver layers may be used as an example when porting to new targets.

**Note:** Using the FreeMASTER tool and FreeMASTER Communication Driver is only allowed in systems based on NXP microcontroller or microprocessor unit. Use with non-NXP MCU platforms is **not permitted** by the license terms.

# Target platforms

The driver implementation uses the following abstraction mechanisms which simplify driver porting and supporting new communication modules:

- **General CPU Platform** (see source code in the `src/platforms` directory). The code in this layer is only specific to native data type sizes and CPU architectures (for example; alignment-aware memory copy routines). This driver version brings two generic implementations of 32-bit platforms supporting both little-endian and big-endian architectures. There are also implementations customized for the 56F800E family of digital signal controllers and S12Z MCUs.

- **Transport Communication Layer** - The Serial, CAN, Networking, PD-BDM, and other methods of transport logic are implemented as a driver layer called FMSTR_TRANSPORT with a uniform API. A support of the Network transport also extends single-client modes of operation which are native for Serial, USB and CAN by a concept of multiple client sessions.

- **Low-level Communication Driver** - Each type of transport further defines a low-level API used to access the physical communication module. For example, the Serial transport defines a character-oriented API implemented by different serial communication modules like UART, LPUART, USART, and also USB-CDC. Similarly, the CAN transport defines a message-oriented API implemented by the FlexCAN or MCAN modules. Moreover, there are multiple different implementations for the same kind of communication peripherals. The difference between the implementation is in the way the low-level hardware registers are accessed. The *mcuxsdk* folder contains implementations which use MCUXpresso SDK drivers. These drivers should be used in applications based on the NXP MCUXpresso SDK. The "ampsdk" drivers target automotive-specific MCUs and their respective SDKs. The "dreg" implementations use a plain C-language access to hardware register addresses which makes it a universal and the most portable solution. In this case, users are encouraged to add more drivers for other communication modules or other respective SDKs and contribute the code back to NXP for integration.

   The low-level drivers defined for the Networking transport enable datagram-oriented UDP and stream TCP communication. This implementation is demonstrated using the lwIP software stack but shall be portable to other TCP/IP stacks. It may sound surprisingly, but also the Segger J-Link RTT communication driver is linked to the Networking transport (RTT is stream oriented communication handled similarly to TCP).


# Replacing existing drivers

For all supported platforms, the driver described in this document replaces the V2 implementation and also older driver implementations that were available separately for individual platforms (PC Master SCI drivers).

# Clocks, pins, and peripheral initialization

The FreeMASTER communication driver is only responsible for runtime processing of the communication and must be integrated with an user application code to function properly. The user application code is responsible for general initialization of clock sources, pin multiplexers, and peripheral registers related to the communication speed. Such initialization should be done before calling the `FMSTR_Init` function.

It is recommended to develop the user application using one of the Software Development Kits (SDKs) available from third parties or directly from NXP, such as MCUXpresso SDK, MCUXpresso IDE, and related tools. This approach simplifies the general configuration process significantly.

# MCUXpresso SDK

The MCUXpresso SDK is a software package provided by NXP which contains the device initialization code, linker files, and software drivers with example applications for the NXP family of MCUs. The MCUXpresso Config Tools may be used to generate the clock-setup and pin-multiplexer setup code suitable for the selected processor.

The MCUXpresso SDK also contains this FreeMASTER communication driver as a “middleware” component which may be downloaded along with the example applications from [https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/en/welcome](https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/en/welcome).

## MCUXpresso SDK on GitHub

The FreeMASTER communication driver is also released as one of the middleware components of the MCUXpresso SDK on the GitHub. This release enables direct integration of the FreeMASTER source code Git repository into a target applications.

# FMSTR_PipeWrite

##### Prototype

```c
FMSTR_PIPE_SIZE FMSTR_PipeWrite(FMSTR_HPIPE pipeHandle, FMSTR_ADDR pipeData, 
	FMSTR_PIPE_SIZE pipeDataLen, FMSTR_PIPE_SIZE writeGranularity);
```

- Declaration: *freemaster.h*
- Implementation: *freemaster_pipes.c*

##### Arguments

 - *pipeHandle* [in] - pipe handle returned from the FMSTR_PipeOpen function call
 - *pipeData* [in] - address of the data to be written
 - *pipeDataLen* [in] - length of the data to be written
 - *writeGranularity* [in] - size of the minimum unit of data which is to be written

##### Description

This function puts the user-specified data into the pipeâ€™s transmit memory buffer and schedules it for transmission. This function returns the number of bytes that were successfully written into the buffer. This number may be smaller than the number of the requested bytes if there is not enough free space in the transmit buffer.

The *writeGranularity*  argument can be used to split the data into smaller chunks, each of the size given by the *writeGranularity* value. The FMSTR_PipeWrite function writes as many data chunks as possible into the transmit buffer and does not attempt to write an incomplete chunk. This feature can prove to be useful to avoid the intermediate caching when writing an array of integer values or other multi-byte data items. When making the nGranularity value equal to the nLength value, all data are considered as one chunk which is either written successfully as a whole or not at all. The nGranularity value of 0 or 1 disables the data-chunk approach.
